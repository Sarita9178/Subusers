# SubUser
In the SubUser section of the guide, you will learn how to create and use internal users to manage the customers. Every user will be assigned with some roles (super admin, password admin, user admin etc.) and permissions (read, write, view, edit etc.). These roles and permissions are centrally managed in the admin panel. The users will have separate logins as per their roles and can access only the allocated modules.

Following is the menu of a Subusers:
  * All SubUser 
  * Permission/Role

## All Subuser
The subuser page lists all sub users who were added by the administrator. Admin can use the standard controls to sort the list, filter and search subusers by typing in the field under column header value you want to find, and apply actions to selected subusers.

Pagination controls appear if there are more subuser records than fit on the page, and are used to move from one page to the next.
